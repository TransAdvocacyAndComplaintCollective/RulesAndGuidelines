### **Communication Guidelines for the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK (Swarmwise-Inspired)**

---

**Purpose:** These guidelines are inspired by the principles tailored to the unique needs of the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK. They aim to ensure effective, transparent, and decentralised communication within our collective, empowering all members to contribute to our shared goals.

**1\. Core Communication Principles:**

* **Transparency:** All communication should be open and accessible to the entire collective. Transparency fosters trust and allows everyone to stay informed and engaged.  
* **Decentralization:** Empower members at all levels to take initiative in communication. Anyone can propose ideas, start discussions, or share information that aligns with our mission.  
* **Respect and Inclusivity:** Treat all members and external contacts with respect. Our communication should be inclusive, valuing diverse perspectives and ensuring everyone feels heard and respected.  
* **Clarity and Simplicity:** Keep communication clear and to the point. Avoid jargon or overly complex language to ensure everyone can understand and participate.

**2\. Internal Communication Channels:**

* **Discord:** Our primary platform for real-time communication. It allows for decentralized discussions across various channels dedicated to specific topics or projects. Members are encouraged to create new channels as needed.  
* **Forums/Wikis:** Use forums or wikis for more structured, asynchronous communication. These platforms are ideal for in-depth discussions, resource sharing, and documenting decisions.  
* **Heartbeat Messages:** Regular, brief updates from leaders or active members to keep everyone aligned with ongoing activities and goals. These can be posted on Discord or sent via email.  
* **Ad-Hoc Meetings:** Informal, on-demand meetings can be called by any member who needs to discuss a specific issue. These meetings are recorded or summarized for those who couldn’t attend.

**3\. External Communication:**

* **Distributed Media Engagement:** Any member can engage with media or public platforms as long as they align their message with the collective’s values and mission. Coordination with the PR/Media team is encouraged but not mandatory.  
* **Social Media Activity:** Members are free to use social media to promote our cause, share successes, and engage with supporters. Use the hashtag \#TACC\_UK to unify our online presence. Always communicate with respect and avoid escalating conflicts publicly.  
* **Official Statements:** While anyone can communicate externally, official statements representing the entire collective should be coordinated and approved by a consensus of key members or the PR/Media team.

**4\. Decision-Making Communication:**

* **Consensus and Action:** Encourage open discussions on key issues. If three or more members agree on a course of action that benefits the collective, they are empowered to proceed (following the “three-activist rule”).  
* **Feedback Loops:** After decisions are made, communicate the outcomes clearly to all members. Feedback is encouraged and should be integrated into future actions to continuously improve our processes.  
* **Conflict Resolution:** Handle disagreements privately and constructively. If an issue escalates, involve impartial members to mediate and resolve the conflict in line with our values of respect and inclusivity.

**5\. Documentation and Record-Keeping:**

* **Open Documentation:** All discussions, decisions, and actions should be documented in open forums or shared documents accessible to all members. This ensures that everyone stays informed and can contribute to the collective knowledge base.  
* **Archiving:** Important communications and decisions should be archived in a way that is easy to access and search. Use wikis or shared drives to maintain these records.

**6\. Inclusivity in Communication:**

* **Encouraging Participation:** Create an environment where all members feel comfortable speaking up. Actively invite input from those who might be quieter or less active.  
* **Language and Accessibility:** Use inclusive language and be mindful of different communication needs. Provide text alternatives for visual content and ensure that discussions are accessible to all members, including those with disabilities.  
* **Decentralized Leadership:** Leadership is fluid and decentralized. Anyone who takes initiative and gains the support of others naturally assumes a leadership role in that context.

**7\. Privacy and Confidentiality:**

* **Public by Default:** Most communication should be public and transparent. However, respect for personal privacy is paramount, and sensitive issues should be discussed in private channels or direct messages.  
* **Secure Communication:** For sensitive information, use secure, encrypted communication methods. Limit access to these discussions to only those who need to know.

**8\. Feedback and Continuous Improvement:**

* **Ongoing Feedback:** Maintain open channels for continuous feedback on communication practices. Regularly review and adjust these guidelines based on member input and the evolving needs of the collective.  
* **Learning and Adaptation:** Encourage members to learn from both successes and mistakes. Share these lessons openly to improve the collective’s effectiveness.

**Final Thoughts:** Our communication is the lifeblood of the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK. By adhering to these swarmwise-inspired guidelines, we empower every member to contribute meaningfully, ensuring that our collective is agile, inclusive, and effective in advocating for trans rights across the UK.
