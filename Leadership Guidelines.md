### **Leadership Guidelines for the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK**

**Introduction**

Welcome to the leadership team of the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK\! Leading within our collective is a dynamic and rewarding challenge. It’s about more than just management; it’s about inspiring others, fostering a sense of community, and driving forward our mission to advocate for trans rights and combat transphobia across the UK.

### **Our Leadership Philosophy**

Leadership in the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK is rooted in transparency, collaboration, and respect. As leaders, our primary responsibility is to maintain the collective’s focus on our mission and to sustain the positive energy that fuels our activism. Here’s how we achieve this:

#### **1\. Model Positive Behavior**

* **Monkey See, Monkey Do:** As leaders, we act as role models for the rest of the collective. Our actions set the tone for the organization. When we approach situations with positivity and respect, we encourage others to do the same. Conversely, negative behaviors such as criticism or condescension can spread just as easily, so we must be vigilant in maintaining a supportive and encouraging atmosphere.  
* **Communication:** In all our communications, especially online where nuances like tone and body language are absent, we strive to be clear, kind, and constructive. This reduces misunderstandings and promotes a culture of mutual respect.

#### **2\. Decision-Making and Accountability**

* **Empowerment through Decisions:** As leaders, we are entrusted with the authority to make decisions within our areas of responsibility. This authority is a key part of our role, and we are encouraged to use it confidently. However, we must also be mindful of the impact our decisions have on the collective and be prepared to revise them if they cause significant concerns.  
* **Independent Action:** While we are empowered to make decisions, we also value input and collaboration. We aim to strike a balance between making independent decisions and considering the perspectives of those affected by them. Voting is a last resort, as we believe in fostering consensus wherever possible.

#### **3\. Inspiring and Guiding, Not Commanding**

* **Lead by Suggesting:** In our collective, leadership is about inspiration, not orders. We guide others by sharing our vision and inviting them to join us. For example, we might say, "I’m planning to organise a campaign around X issue because I believe it will achieve Y. If others are interested, we could accomplish Z together."  
* **Role Models and Recognition:** We actively promote behaviours we wish to see more of by recognizing and rewarding them. This includes praising those who support and uplift their peers, as well as celebrating individual achievements that contribute to our collective goals.

#### **4\. Promoting a Culture of Trust and Respect**

* **Assume Good Faith:** We start from the premise that everyone involved in the collective is here to help, even when their actions might not align perfectly with our own views. We approach disagreements with patience and seek to understand the motivations behind others’ actions.  
* **Zero Tolerance for Disrespect:** While we are tolerant of mistakes and differences in judgement, we do not tolerate disrespect towards any member of the collective. Disrespectful behaviour, including bullying or condescension, is addressed immediately and decisively. Our aim is to ensure that everyone feels safe and valued in their role within the collective.

#### **5\. Personal Responsibility in Communication**

* **Speak for Yourself:** When addressing concerns, we always speak from our own perspective. We use statements like "When X happens, I feel Y because of Z," rather than attributing our opinions to others or speaking on behalf of the group. This promotes constructive dialogue and reduces defensiveness.  
* **Stand by Your Opinions:** We do not hide behind the views of others or invoke anonymous "many people" to bolster our arguments. We take responsibility for our own opinions and express them with honesty and respect.

#### **6\. Focus on Activism, Minimise Bureaucracy**

* **Keep It Light:** Administrative tasks are necessary, but they should never overshadow our core mission of activism. We regularly assess our processes to ensure they serve our advocacy goals and do not become burdensome.  
* **Support, Don’t Overburden:** We aim to keep the administrative weight light, allowing more energy and resources to be devoted to our primary goal: advocating for trans rights and combating transphobia.

#### **7\. Building and Sustaining Connections**

* **Fostering Relationships:** We encourage social connections within the collective. These relationships strengthen our community and make our work more enjoyable and effective.  
* **Developing Leaders:** We believe that leadership is a skill that can be developed. We support each other in growing as activists and leaders, offering guidance, training, and mentorship to those who seek it.
