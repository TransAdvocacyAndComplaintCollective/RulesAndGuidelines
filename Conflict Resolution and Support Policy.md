**Introduction**

The Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK (TACC-UK) is committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment where all members can collaborate effectively toward our shared goals. This Conflict Resolution and Support Policy outlines the principles, procedures, and resources available for addressing conflicts and ensuring the well-being of all members.

**1\. Principles**

* **Respect and Dignity:** All members of TACC-UK are expected to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of differences in opinion, background, or identity.  
* **Inclusivity:** Our collective values diversity and strives to create a space where all voices are heard and respected.  
* **Transparency:** Conflict resolution processes will be transparent, ensuring that all parties understand the steps involved and the rationale behind decisions.  
* **Confidentiality:** While transparency is important, the privacy of individuals involved in conflicts will be respected. Sensitive information will be shared on a need-to-know basis only.  
* **Support:** We are committed to providing emotional and practical support to members experiencing conflict or personal challenges.

**2\. Types of Conflicts**

Conflicts within TACC-UK may arise due to:

* Differences in opinions or approaches to collective activities.  
* Interpersonal disagreements between members.  
* Miscommunication or misunderstandings.  
* Disputes over roles, responsibilities, or resource allocation.

**3\. Conflict Resolution Process**

**Step 1: Self-Resolution**

* Members are encouraged to address minor conflicts directly with the other party involved. A respectful and open conversation can often resolve misunderstandings before they escalate.

**Step 2: Mediation**

* If self-resolution is not possible or effective, members can request mediation. A neutral third party from the collective, known as a **Conflict Mediator**, will facilitate a discussion between the parties involved.  
* The Conflict Mediator will listen to all perspectives, help clarify the issues, and guide the parties toward a mutually agreeable solution.  
* Mediation sessions will be confidential, and the mediator will ensure that the discussion remains respectful and focused on resolution.

**Step 3: Formal Resolution**

* If mediation does not resolve the conflict, the issue can be escalated to the **Conflict Resolution Committee** (CRC). The CRC is a small group of experienced members appointed by the collective to handle more complex disputes.  
* The CRC will review the case, gather relevant information, and may hold a formal meeting with the involved parties.  
* The CRC will issue a resolution, which may include recommendations for behavior changes, role adjustments, or other actions to restore harmony within the collective.  
* All decisions made by the CRC will be final and will be communicated clearly to the parties involved.

**4\. Support Structures**

**Emotional Support**

* TACC-UK recognizes that conflicts can be emotionally taxing. We offer peer support through our **Support Coordinators**, who are available to listen and provide guidance. Support Coordinators can also refer members to external resources if needed.

**Safe Spaces**

* The collective is committed to maintaining safe spaces for discussion and collaboration. Any member who feels unsafe or harassed should report the issue to a Support Coordinator or a member of the CRC immediately.

**Resources and Training**

* We provide regular training on conflict resolution, communication skills, and inclusivity to help prevent conflicts and equip members with the tools to handle disagreements constructively.

**5\. Reporting and Feedback**

**Incident Reporting**

* Members who experience or witness conflicts, harassment, or any behavior that violates our collective’s values should report the incident to a Conflict Mediator or Support Coordinator.  
* Reports can be made anonymously if preferred, though providing details may help in resolving the issue more effectively.

**Feedback Mechanism**

* TACC-UK encourages feedback on the conflict resolution process. Members can submit feedback to the CRC to help improve our policies and procedures.

**6\. Accountability**

* All members of TACC-UK are expected to adhere to this Conflict Resolution and Support Policy. Failure to comply with the resolutions set by the CRC may result in a review of the member’s participation in the collective.  
* The CRC will review and update this policy regularly to ensure it meets the needs of our growing collective.

**Conclusion**

The Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK is dedicated to building a positive, collaborative environment where all members can thrive. By following this Conflict Resolution and Support Policy, we aim to resolve disputes fairly and constructively, ensuring that our collective remains united in our mission to advocate for trans rights and challenge transphobia.
