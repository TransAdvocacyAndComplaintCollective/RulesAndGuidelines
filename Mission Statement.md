### **Our Objectives**

1. **Advocacy**  
   We actively work to influence public policy, healthcare practices, and social attitudes to protect and promote the rights of trans people. This includes advocating for better access to gender-affirming healthcare, challenging discriminatory laws and practices, and pushing for greater representation of trans voices in all areas of society.  
2. **Media Accountability**

3. **Support and Resources**  
   We provide a range of support services for trans individuals, including resources for navigating healthcare, legal advice, and peer support networks. Our collective serves as a hub for information and assistance, helping trans people access the support they need.  
4. **Community Building**  
   We foster a strong, supportive community where trans people and allies can connect, share experiences, and find solidarity. Through regular events, both online and in-person, we create spaces where our members can feel safe, supported, and empowered.  
5. **Education and Awareness**  
   We educate the public about trans issues and promote greater understanding and acceptance of trans people. Through workshops, public speaking, and educational campaigns, we aim to reduce ignorance and prejudice, contributing to a more inclusive society.

### **Commitment to Action**

At TACC UK, we believe that real change comes from collective action. We encourage all members to take initiative, whether that’s leading a campaign, organizing a protest, or simply sharing their story. Together, we can challenge transphobia, support each other, and create a more just and equal society for all.
