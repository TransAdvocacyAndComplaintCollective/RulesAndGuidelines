**Introduction**

Welcome to the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK\! Our collective is built on a foundation of shared values that guide our actions, shape our culture, and drive our mission to advocate for trans rights and challenge transphobia across the UK. These values are the heart of who we are and how we operate as a community.

### **Our Core Values**

#### **1\. Solidarity and Unity**

* **Collective Strength:** We believe in the power of unity. Together, we amplify our voices and create a stronger, more resilient movement. Our collective is a space where trans people and allies can stand together against discrimination and work towards shared goals.  
* **Mutual Support:** We are committed to supporting one another, both in activism and in our personal journeys. We provide a safe and inclusive space where members can share resources, offer advice, and celebrate each other’s successes.

#### **2\. Empowerment Through Action**

* **Proactive Advocacy:** We are dedicated to taking concrete actions to combat transphobia and promote trans rights. Whether through organized campaigns, media complaints, or documentation of transphobic events, we believe in the power of action to drive change.  
* **Autonomy and Initiative:** Every member of our collective is empowered to take initiative. We encourage each other to propose ideas, lead projects, and make decisions that align with our mission. We trust in our collective’s ability to create meaningful impact through the diverse actions of its members.

#### **3\. Transparency and Accountability**

* **Open Communication:** We value transparency in our decision-making processes and strive to maintain open lines of communication within the collective. We believe that everyone’s voice should be heard and respected.  
* **Responsibility:** We hold ourselves accountable for our actions and decisions. We learn from our mistakes and continuously strive to improve. When we commit to an action, we stand by it and work to see it through with integrity.

#### **4\. Respect and Inclusivity**

* **Diversity of Voices:** Our collective thrives on the diversity of its members. We value different perspectives and experiences, recognizing that this diversity strengthens our advocacy and enriches our community.  
* **Inclusive Environment:** We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive space for all members, regardless of their gender identity, background, or experience level. Disrespectful or exclusionary behaviour is not tolerated within our collective.

#### **5\. Courage and Resilience**

* **Bravery in the Face of Adversity:** We recognize that the fight for trans rights is challenging, and we are not afraid to face difficult situations head-on. We approach our activism with courage, knowing that our efforts are vital in the struggle for equality.  
* **Resilience in Advocacy:** When faced with setbacks, we remain resilient. We understand that meaningful change takes time and perseverance, and we are committed to sustaining our efforts for the long term.

#### **6\. Collaboration and Cooperation**

* **Working Together:** Collaboration is at the core of our collective. We believe that by working together, we can achieve more than we could individually. We foster a cooperative environment where ideas are shared, and efforts are united towards common goals.  
* **Building Bridges:** We seek to build alliances with other organisations and communities that share our values. Through cooperation, we strengthen our impact and extend the reach of our advocacy.

#### **7\. Positive Impact and Growth**

* **Focus on Solutions:** We are solution-oriented in our activism. Rather than dwelling on problems, we focus on finding and implementing solutions that advance trans rights and combat transphobia.  
* **Continuous Growth:** We are committed to the ongoing growth and development of our collective and its members. We encourage learning, skill-building, and personal development to enhance our effectiveness as advocates and as a community.
