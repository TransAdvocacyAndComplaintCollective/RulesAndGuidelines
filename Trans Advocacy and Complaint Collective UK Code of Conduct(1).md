### **Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK Code of Conduct**

**Introduction**

The Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK is committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for all its members. Our collective is dedicated to advocating for trans rights and addressing transphobia across the UK. This Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behaviour expected from all members to ensure that our community remains welcoming and effective in achieving its mission.

**1\. Respect and Inclusion**

* **Respect for All:** Every member of the collective is expected to treat others with respect and dignity. Discrimination, harassment, or any form of abuse based on gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, religion, or any other characteristic is strictly prohibited.  
* **Inclusive Language:** Use language that is inclusive and affirming of all gender identities and expressions. Misgendering, deadnaming, or using derogatory terms is not tolerated.  
* **Safe Spaces:** We strive to create spaces, both online and offline, where all members feel safe and supported. This includes respecting personal boundaries, ensuring consent in all interactions, and being mindful of the diverse experiences and needs within our community.

**2\. Collaboration and Communication**

* **Constructive Feedback:** When offering feedback, do so constructively, focusing on ideas and actions rather than personal attributes. We encourage healthy debate and the sharing of diverse perspectives in a manner that is respectful and aims to build up, rather than tear down.  
* **Positive Communication:** Avoid language or actions that could escalate conflicts. If disagreements arise, address them calmly and with the goal of finding common ground or agreeing to disagree respectfully.  
* **Transparency:** Be open and honest in your communications. Share information, ideas, and concerns in a way that contributes to the collective’s goals and fosters a culture of trust and accountability.

**3\. Accountability and Integrity**

* **Personal Responsibility:** Each member is responsible for their actions and the impact they have on others. Own your mistakes, learn from them, and strive to do better.  
* **Upholding the Collective’s Values:** Members are expected to act in accordance with the collective’s mission and values at all times. This includes not engaging in any activities that could harm the reputation or effectiveness of the collective.  
* **Confidentiality:** Respect the confidentiality of sensitive information shared within the collective. Do not disclose any information that could compromise the safety or privacy of any member.

**4\. Participation and Engagement**

* **Active Contribution:** All members are encouraged to participate actively in the collective’s activities, whether through direct activism, offering support, or contributing ideas. Every voice is valuable, and every contribution helps us achieve our goals.  
* **Support and Empowerment:** Support your fellow members by recognizing their contributions, offering help when needed, and empowering others to take initiative. We grow stronger as a collective when we uplift each other.  
* **No Gatekeeping:** Avoid behaviors that discourage or exclude others from participating. Welcome new members, help them integrate into the collective, and encourage diverse involvement at all levels.

**5\. Conflict Resolution**

* **Addressing Issues:** If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, report it to the designated support coordinators or leadership members. All reports will be taken seriously and addressed promptly.  
* **Mediation and Support:** Where possible, conflicts should be resolved through mediation and mutual understanding. The collective will provide support to facilitate these discussions and ensure that resolutions align with our values.  
* **Zero Tolerance for Abuse:** Harassment, bullying, or any form of abuse will result in immediate action, which may include removal from the collective. We prioritize the safety and well-being of all members.

**6\. Commitment to Growth**

* **Continuous Learning:** Members are encouraged to engage in continuous learning about issues related to trans rights, activism, and social justice. This commitment to growth helps us better advocate for our community and support each other.  
* **Feedback Loop:** We welcome feedback on this Code of Conduct and our collective practices. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure that our guidelines remain relevant and effective.
