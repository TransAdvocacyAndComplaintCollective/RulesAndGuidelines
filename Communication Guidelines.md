**Introduction**

Effective communication is the backbone of the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK. As a decentralised and swarm-based organisation, our success depends on transparent, inclusive, and positive communication among all members. These guidelines are designed to ensure that our communication supports our mission, fosters collaboration, and maintains the integrity of our collective.

**Core Principles of Communication**

1. **Transparency**  
   * All discussions, decisions, and documents should be open and accessible to all members, except when privacy is necessary to protect sensitive or personal information.  
   * Major decisions, strategies, and updates should be communicated clearly and promptly to ensure all members are informed and can contribute.  
2. **Inclusivity**  
   * We strive to create a communication environment where all voices are heard, respected, and considered. Everyone is encouraged to participate, regardless of their role or level of involvement.  
   * Language should be inclusive and respectful, avoiding jargon, acronyms, or terms that may exclude or alienate others.  
3. **Positive and Constructive Dialogue**  
   * Communication should focus on solutions, collaboration, and shared goals. Criticism should be constructive and delivered with the intent to improve our collective efforts.  
   * Disagreements are natural and can be productive if approached respectfully. Members should aim to understand different perspectives and find common ground.  
4. **Empowerment Through Communication**  
   * Members are encouraged to take initiative in communicating ideas, starting discussions, and leading projects. We trust each other to act in the best interest of the collective.  
   * When someone proposes an idea or project, others should support, offer constructive feedback, or propose alternative approaches, rather than simply criticizing.

**Communication Channels**

1. **Discord Server**  
   * Our Discord server is the primary hub for communication, coordination, and community-building. It includes various channels for different topics, regions, and activities.  
   * Members should use appropriate channels for specific topics to keep discussions organized and relevant.  
   * Moderators are responsible for maintaining a positive and respectful environment on the server. They are also available to assist with any communication issues or conflicts that arise.  
2. **Public Forums and Social Media**  
   * When representing the collective on public platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, forums), members should align their communication with our mission and values.  
   * Official statements or responses to media inquiries should be coordinated through designated communication officers or agreed upon by the group.  
   * Members are free to express their views but should clarify when they are speaking in a personal capacity versus representing the collective.  
3. **Internal Communication Tools**  
   * We use various tools (e.g., shared documents, project management platforms) to coordinate tasks, track progress, and collaborate on projects.  
   * All members should have access to these tools, and instructions or guidelines on how to use them should be provided to new members.  
4. **Meetings and Video Calls**  
   * Meetings, whether online or in person, should be scheduled with clear agendas and objectives. Notes or summaries should be shared afterward to keep everyone informed.  
   * Video calls are an excellent way to build stronger connections within the collective. They should be open to all interested members, with consideration for different time zones and availability.

**Guidelines for Effective Communication**

1. **Clarity and Brevity**  
   * When communicating, be clear and concise. Avoid lengthy messages when a brief one will do, and ensure your point is easily understood.  
   * Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize information and make it more digestible.  
2. **Active Listening**  
   * Listen to others with the intent to understand, not just to respond. Allow others to finish speaking or writing before jumping in with your thoughts.  
   * Acknowledge others’ contributions, even if you disagree, and build on their ideas to foster a collaborative atmosphere.  
3. **Timely Responses**  
   * Aim to respond to messages and inquiries in a timely manner, particularly if they require your input or action. If you cannot respond immediately, acknowledge the message and provide a timeframe for your reply.  
   * For urgent matters, use appropriate channels (e.g., direct messages, specific “urgent” channels) to ensure timely attention.  
4. **Respect for Time and Attention**  
   * Be mindful of others’ time and attention. Before initiating a discussion or sending a message, consider whether it is necessary and relevant to the recipient(s).  
   * Avoid spamming channels or overwhelming members with excessive notifications or non-essential information.  
5. **Conflict Resolution**  
   * If a conflict arises, address it directly and respectfully with the involved parties. Seek to resolve the issue privately first before escalating it to group discussion or involving moderators.  
   * Use “I” statements to express your feelings or concerns, and focus on behaviors rather than personal attacks.

**Role of Communication Officers**

* **Moderation and Support**  
  * Communication officers or moderators are responsible for ensuring that all communication channels remain respectful, positive, and aligned with our collective values.  
  * They provide support to members experiencing communication issues and facilitate conflict resolution when necessary.  
* **Coordination of Official Communications**  
  * Communication officers manage the dissemination of official messages, press releases, and public statements. They ensure consistency in the collective’s voice and messaging.
